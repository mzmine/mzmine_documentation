# Data import

##LC-MS data
Raw data can be imported via the main menu **Raw data methods → Raw data import**. Note that
multiple data files/folders can be dropped into the
**MS data (advanced)** dialog. If individual modules are used, folder based formats can only
imported as one folder at a time. When using the **MS data (advanced)** dialog, inexperienced users
should deactivate the direct mass detection steps, since they alter the raw data on the import. Mass
detection is then performend, when the scans are loaded and only peaks above the noise level are
imported.

Alternatively, you can simply drag & drop the raw data into the raw data list of the main window.
