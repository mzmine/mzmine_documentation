# IMS Expander

The IMS expander will search for data points in mobility scans for existing features. This requires
prior chromatogram building (
see [ADAP Chromatogram builder](adap-chromatogram-builder.md#adap-chromatogram-builder) and
resolving in retention time dimension (see [Resolving](local-minimum-resolver.md)).

### Parameter settings

#### m/z tolerance

If selected, a tolerance will be applied to the feature's detected m/z while searching for data
points in mobility dimension. Otherwise, the accepted m/z range is determined by the feature's m/z
distribution in accumulated frame spectra.  
**Recommended setting: selected, 0.003 m/z and 15 ppm**

#### Raw data instead of thresholded

Enables searching in mobility scan raw data instead of the thresholded (=mass detected) data. Only
possible for centroid raw data files.

#### Override default mobility bin witdth (scans)

If selected, the default number of binned mobility scans can be overriden. Useful for data with high
mobility resolution. Example: ![](../img/imsworkflow/binnedmobilogram.png)
