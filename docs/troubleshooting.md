# Troubleshooting


## GUI freezes
The graphical user interface freezes sometimes on remote desktops if the user logs out and logs in again. This is a known issue and might be fixed in future JavaFX versions. 


## MZmine does not start
Maybe the MZmine configuration got corrupted (broke). Delete it and reinstall MZmine. The **.mzmine3.conf** file can be found in the user folder and might be hidden. On Windows, activate "Show hidden items" in the Explorer/View menu. 


## Reporting issues
Report issues on the [MZmine GitHub](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/issues), providing all information to reproduce the issue.

**This might include**
- **Input data**? provide example file
-** Batch file** defining processing steps and settings
- attach the log file located in the user folder: **mzmine_0_0.log** 
- Expected behavior
- Issue
