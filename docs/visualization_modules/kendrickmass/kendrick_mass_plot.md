# **4D features plot (Kendrick mass plot)**

## **Description**

:material-menu-open: **Visualization → 4D features plot (Kendrick)**

In 1963 Kendrick published his idea of a mass scale, the so-called Kendrick mass scale, which is
based on defining the mass of CH2 as 14.0000 u.

The Kendrick mass scale is calculated by multiplying the IUPAC mass scale with the factor 14.0000
u/14.01565 u = 0.9988834. This results in the same mass defect for homologous components, the
so-called **Kendrick mass defect (KMD)**. The KMD is defined as the \(\Delta\) of a nominal Kendrick
mass and its associated Kendrick mass. Using the Kendrick mass scale has the purpose of data
reduction.

\[KM(R)=m/z\cdot\frac{round(R)}{R}\]

\[KMD(R)=round(KM(R))-KM(R)\]

where \(KM\) is Kendrick mass, \(KMD\) - Kendrick mass defect, \(R\) - exact mass of selected base
unit.

## **Detailed functionality**

This module allows to create 4 dimensional Kendrick mass plots. Feature characteristics, such as
retention time or feature area, can be plotted as color scale or bubble size.

### **Charge dependent Kendrick mass plots**

Multiply charged ions can cause splits in Kendrick mass plot. Fouquet et al. have shown considering
the charge for the calculation of the KM can help to overcome this problem through clustering of
features.

\[KM(R,Z)=Z\cdot KM(R)=Z\cdot m/z\cdot \frac{round(R)}{R}\]

where \(Z\) is charge.

### **Resolution enhanced Kendrick mass defect plots**

Fouquet and Sato have shown that a fractional base unit (ivisor) can enhance the resolution of
Kendrick mass plots.

\[X>1, KM(R,X)=m/z\cdot \frac{round(R/X)}{R/X}\]

where \(X\) is a fractional base unit.

### **Combining charge and fractional base unit (Divisor)**

If both charge and fractional base unit are changed, the following equation is used:

\[KM(R,Z,X)=Z\cdot KM(RX)=Z\cdot m/z\cdot \frac{round(R/X)}{R/X}\]

### **Remainders of Kendrick masses (RKM)**

Another option to increase the resolution of Kendrick mass plots is the by Fouquet et al. proposed
concept of RKM (remainders of Kendrick masses).
\[RKM(R)=\Bigg\{\frac{KM(R)}{round(R)}\Bigg\}\]

with \(\{ \}\) being the fractional part function defined as \(x=x-floor(x)\)

## Region of interest ROI extraction

The Kendrick/4D plot can be used to extract regions of interest from a plot. E.g., you can use this
to extract polymers, PFAS, Lipids and more depending on their localization in a m/z vs. RT plot or
in a Kendrick plot.

1. Find the "Region" panel below the kendrick plot ![region.png](region.png)
2. Start drawing by pressing the "Start" button.
3. Draw your region of interest in the plot. Unfinished ROIs will be filled in
   gray. ![region_unfinished.png](region_unfinished.png)
4. Finish drawing the region by pressing the "Finish" button. The finished region will just be
   outlined. ![region_finished.png](region_finished.png)
5. Click the "Extract to feature list" button to create a new feature list of features in this
   region.

!!! Note: The chart supports multiple regions. Region drawing can be canceled, regions can be
removed or loaded and saved using the respective buttons.

!!! Batch mode: To use the ROI extraction in the batch mode, set up the desired ROI using the 4D
chart and save the region or extract it. You can either save the whole batch from the feature list
summary or load the regions into the 'Region extraction' module.
