# **Visualization modules**

 MZmine provides a rangle of interactive visualization tools for analysis of raw and processed data. JFreeChart library is used for majority of plots. Most of the generated plots are interactive.

The following **functions** are available:

- Use the + or - key on the keyboard to zoom in or out.
- Scroll with the mouse to zoom in or out.
- Drag the mouse from left to right to select the area to zoom in.
- Drag the mouse from right to left to zoom out to the default view.
- Single click on the y-axis to auto set the intensity to auto height.
- Double click on the y- or x-axis to reset the zoom to default.

In the right part of the plot there is a toolbar. Its functionality is also included in a pop-up menu, which appears when you make right click on the plot area.

**TODO**: Add video of working with plots
